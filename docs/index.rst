Example: ZTF
==================
Medford et. al 2021 published 128 microlensing events in the ZTF footprint, including ~1500 candidates that are being followed up to-date. 

We will train LIA to detect microlensing signatures in the ZTF footprint using these 128 confirmed events. The data file 'level6_events.fits' can be found here: https://zenodo.org/record/5120987
